Market Configurations
=====================

The market configuration allows an extensive configuration of multiple bidding options.
A full list of configurations and explanation of the :meth:`assume.common.market_objects.MarketConfig` is given here.

 ============================= =====================================================


Here, a description of all options and the usage is given.

The `opening_hours` is a recurrence rule which defines when the market is open.
The `opening_duration` is a timedelta which defines how long the market is open. This can be used to leave time for negotiation in the agents.
The `market_mechanism` is the name of the clearing method used for this market, and is mapped to the actual clearing_function in the initialization.
The `minimum_bid_price`, `maximum_bid_price` and `maximum_bid_volume` are constraints for bids. All Bids of the sent orderbook are rejected and not considered for clearing if one or more are not in these bounds.
An agent receives a "Rejected" message if this is the case.
The `additional_fields` is a list of additional fields which are used to base the bid on.
The `price_tick` and `volume_tick` is the step increment of volume, which ensures that only integers are used for calculation.
The `price_unit` and `volume_unit` are strings for visualization of price.
The `supports_get_unmatched` is a boolean which defines if the market supports the handle_get_unmatched method, which allows agents to look into the current market orderbook, as it is the case, mostly on continuous markets.
The `maximum_gradient` is the maximum allowed change between bids from one hour to the next one - only relevant if the count of market products is greater than 1.

Most important, the `market_products` are a list of MarketProduct objects.

MarketProduct
-------------

Each :meth:`assume.common.market_objects.MarketProduct` contains the three informations:

- duration (a relative timedelta or recurrency rule)
- count (how many consecutive products are available for trading)
- first_delivery (a relative timedelta of the first delivery in relation to market start)
- only_hours (tuple of hours from which this product is available, on multi day products)

For example, if the duration is 1 hour, the count is 4 and first_delivery is 2 hours, then a market which opens at 12:00 will have the following products:

- 14:00 - 15:00
- 15:00 - 16:00
- 16:00 - 17:00
- 17:00 - 18:00

It then makes sense to reschedule the market clearing all 4 hours, but it would also be possible to schedule the same clearing interval an hour later too, which would look like this:

Please note, Trade Convention
-----------------------------

In our market trading system, we follow this convention for representing the volume and price of trades in any market:

- **Volume Representation**:
    - The sign of the volume indicates the direction of the trade:
    - **Positive Volume**: Indicates that the volume is being sold to the market.
    - **Negative Volume**: Indicates that the volume is being bought from the market.

- **Price Representation**:
  - The price of a trade can be negative and positive.
  - The price does not change based on the direction of the trade (Providing energy/power or procurring energy/power) but potentially the financial flow.
  - **Positive Volume and Positive Price**: Indicates that electricity is sold to the market, and money is received for it.
  - **Positive Volume and Negative Price**: Indicates that electricity is sold to the market, but money has to be paid for it.
  - **Negative Volume and Positive Price**: Indicates that electricity is bought from the market, and money is paid for it.
  - **Negative Volume and Negative Price**: Indicates that electricity is bought from the market, and money is received for it.


This convention ensures clarity and consistency in how trades are represented and interpreted within the market. By using positive and negative volumes to indicate the direction of trades, we can easily distinguish between buying and selling activities while maintaining a straightforward and unambiguous pricing structure.


Example Configuration - CRM Market
----------------------------------

An example of a EOM and CRM market is shown here.
It is possible to trade at the EOM and sell positive capacity on the CRM too::

   markets_config:
    EOM:
      operator: EOM_operator
      product_type: energy
      start_date: 2019-01-01 01:00
      products:
        - duration: 1h
          count: 1
          first_delivery: 1h
      opening_frequency: 1h
      opening_duration: 1h
      market_mechanism: pay_as_clear

    CRM_pos:
      operator: CRM_operator
      product_type: capacity_pos
      start_date: 2019-01-01 00:00
      products:
        - duration: 4h
          count: 1
          first_delivery: 2h
      opening_frequency: 4h
      opening_duration: 30m
      market_mechanism: pay_as_bid

Due to the configuration of the market opening frequency and duration, the timetable for the opening and closing of the markets, as well as the delivery periods are shown below
