ASSUME: Agent-Based Electricity Markets Simulation Toolbox
===========================================================

**ASSUME** is an open-source tool-box for an agent-based simulation
of the European electricity and later on energy markets with a main
focus on the German market setup. As a newly developed open-source
model its priority is to ensure usability and customisability
for a variety of users and use cases in the energy system modelling community.

The unique feature of the ASSUME tool-box is the integration of **deep reinforcement
learning** methods into the behavioural strategies of market agents.
The model comes with different predefined agent representations for the demand and
generation side that can be used as plug-and-play modules,
which facilitate reinforcement of learning strategies.
This setup enables a research of new market designs and dynamics in the energy markets.

The project is developed by `developers <https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers.html>`_ from INATECH at University of Freiburg, IISM at KIT, Fraunhofer ISI, FH Aachen.
The project ASSUME is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic
Affairs and Energy (BMWK).

how to :doc:`installation` the project.
