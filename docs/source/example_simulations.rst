Example Simulations
=====================

While the modeller can define her own input data for the simulation, we provide some example simulations to get started.
Here you can find an overview of the different exampels provided.

 ============================= ============================= =====================================================
  small                         example_01a                     Small Simulation (4 actors) with single hour bidding.
  small_dam                     example_01a                     Small simulation with 24 hour bidding.
  small_with_opt_clearing       example_01a                     Small simulation with optimization clearing instead of pay_as_clear.
  small_with_BB                 example_01e                     Small Simulation with Block Bids and complex clearing.
  small_with_vre                example_01b                     Small simulation with variable renewable energy.
                                example_01c                     A small study with CRM markets
  learning_small                example_02a                     A small study with roughly 10 powerplants, where one powerplant is equiped with a learning bidding strategy and can learn to exert market power.
  learning_medium               example_02b                     A small study with roughly 10 powerplants, where multiple powerplants are equiped with a learning bidding strategy and learn that they do not have market power anymore.
