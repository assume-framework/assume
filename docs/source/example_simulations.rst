Key Features of Example Simulations
-----------------------------------

1. Small-scale examples (small_*):

   - Designed for easier understanding of specific features and configurations.
   - Demonstrate various market mechanisms, bidding strategies, and technologies.
   - Useful for learning ASSUME's basic functionalities and exploring specific market aspects.

   - Illustrate how agents can adapt their behavior in different market conditions.
   - small_learning_1, small_learning_2, and small_learning_3 directly correspond to Cases 1, 2, and 3, respectively, in the publication by Harder et al. [1]_.
   - Demonstrate practical applications of reinforcement learning in energy markets.

3. Large-scale examples (large_2019_*, large_2021_rl):

   - Represent real-world scenarios based on the German power market in 2019 and 2021.
   - Include full demand and renewable generation profiles, major generation units, and storage facilities.
