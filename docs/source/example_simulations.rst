Example Simulations
=====================

While the modeller can define her own input data for the simulation, we provide some example simulations to get started.
Here you can find an overview of the different exampels provided.

  small                         example_01a                     The dimension of the observations given to the actor in the bidding strategy.
  small_dam                     example_01a                     The dimension of the observations given to the actor in the bidding strategy.
  small_with_opt_clearing       example_01a                     The dimension of the observations given to the actor in the bidding strategy.
  small_with_BB                 example_01e                     The dimension of the actors made by the actor, which equals the output neurons of the actor neuronal net.
  small_with_vre                example_01b                     Whether to use pre-learned strategies and then continue learning.
                                example_01c                     If pre-learned strategies should be used, where are they stored.
  learning_small                example_02a                     A small study with roughly 10 powerplants, where one powerplant is equiped with a learning bidding strategy and can learn to exert market power.
  learning_medium               example_02b                     A small study with roughly 10 powerplants, where multiple powerplants are equiped with a learning bidding strategy and learn that they do not have market power anymore.
