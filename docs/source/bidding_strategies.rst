Bidding Strategies
=====================

Overview
-------------

The ASSUME framework provides multiple options in terms of Bidding Strategy methodologies:

 ============================= =============================================================
  Bidding Strategy Category     Description
 ============================= =============================================================
  Naive                         Basic form of bids, based on participating in market mechanism that follows the Merit Order principle.
                                External market factors or forecasts are not accounted for, so the bid volume is of the order of its max. power capacity (given ramping constraints)
                                and the price is its marginal cost.
  Standard                      These bidding strategies, based on the flexABLE methodology [`Qussous et al. 2022 <https://doi.org/10.3390/en15020494>`_],
                                are more refined compared to the Naive strategy. They incorporate market dynamics to a greater degree by forecasting market prices,
                                operational history, potential power loss due to heat production,
                                and taking into account the fact that a plant can make bids for multiple markets at the same time.
  DMAS                          TODO
  Learning                      A reinforcement learning (RL) approach designed to optimize bidding strategies for an Energy-Only Market. The agent's actions are two bid prices: one for
                                the inflexible component (P_min) and another for the flexible component (P_max - P_min) of a unit's capacity.
                                The bids are informed by 50 observations, which include forecasted residual load, forecasted price, total capacity,
                                and marginal cost, all contributing to decision-making. Noise can be added to the action to encourage exploration and novelty.

                                The reward system includes profits from accepted bids, operational costs, opportunity costs (penalizing underutilized capacity),
                                and a regret term to minimize missed revenue opportunities. This approach encourages full utilization of the unit's capacity.
  Other                         Other bidding methods not belonging to a specific category.
 ============================= =============================================================

For each Bidding Strategy Category, there are different Bidding Strategy Types based on the unit type (Power Plant, Storage, Demand-Side Management (DSM)) that is making the bid,
and the Market Type the bid is made for (Energy-Only Market (EOM), Positive/Negative Control Reserve Market (PCRM/NCRM), Redispatch Market). The following sections describe these
Bidding Strategy Types per category.

 ================================================= ========================== =============================================================
  Energy-Only Market Power Plant Bid                eom_powerplant             A more refined approach to bidding on the EOM compared to :code:`naive_eom_powerplant`.
                                                                               A unit submits both inflexible and flexible bids per hour.
                                                                               The inflexible bid represents the minimum power output, priced at marginal cost plus startup costs,
                                                                               while the flexible bid covers additional power up to the maximum capacity at marginal cost.
                                                                               It incorporates price forecasting and accounts for ramping constraints, operational history,

  Energy-Only Market Power Plant Block Bid          eom_block_powerplant       Formulated similarly to :code:`eom_powerplant`, however it is a block bid for multiple hours.
                                                                               A minimum acceptance ratio (MAR) defines how to handle the possibility of rejected bids
                                                                               within individual hours of the block.
                                                                               It set to 1, meaning that all bids within the block must be accepted otherwise the whole block bid is rejected.
                                                                               See the (`Advanced Orders tutorial <https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/06_advanced_orders_example.html#1.-Basics>`_)

  Energy-Only Market Linked Bid                     eom_linked_powerplant      Similar to :code:`eom_block_powerplant`, however the MAR for children (flexible) bids can be less than that of the parent (inflexible) bids.
  Negative Control Reserve Market Bid               ncrm_powerplant            A bid on the negative Capacity or Energy CRM, volume is determined by calculating how much it can reduce power. The capacity price is
                                                                               found by comparing the revenue it could receive if it bid this volume on the EOM, the energy price is the negative of marginal cost.
  Positive Control Reserve Market Bid               pcrm_powerplant            A bid on the positive Capacity or Energy CRM, volume is determined by calculating how much it can increase power. The capacity price is
                                                                               found by comparing the revenue it could receive if it bid this volume on the EOM, the energy price is the marginal cost.
  Energy-Only Market Storage Bid                    eom_storage                Determines strategy of Storage unit bidding on the EOM. The unit acts as generator or load based on average price forecast.
                                                                               If the current price forecast is greater than the average price, the Storage unit will bid to discharge at a price
                                                                               equal to the average price divided by the discharge efficiency. Otherwise, it will bid to charge at the average price
                                                                               multiplied by the charge efficiency. Calculates ramping constraints for charging and discharging based on theoretical state of charge (SOC),
                                                                               ensuring that power output is feasible.
  Negative Control Reserve Market Storage Bid       ncrm_storage               Analogous to :code:`eom_storage`, but bids either on the negative capacity CRM or energy CRM.
  Positive Control Reserve Market Storage Bid       pcrm_storage               Analogous to :code:`eom_storage`, but bids either on the positive capacity CRM or energy CRM.
