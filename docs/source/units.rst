Unit Types
##########

This section describes the different generation and demand unit types that are available in ASSUME. By default,
we provide a set of most widely used unit types such as power plants, storage units, and demand units. However,
the user can define new unit types by building upon one of the base classes or built-in unit types. These unit types can later be imported into ASSUME.
Alternatively, if you believe, that this particular unit type would be a good addition to the default set of unit types, please create a pull request.
