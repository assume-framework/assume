    "# 11. Redispatch modelling using PyPSA\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates modelling and simulation of redispatch mechanism using PyPSA as a plug and play module in ASSUME-framework. The model will be created mainly taking grid constraints into consideration to identify grid bottlenecks with dispatches from EOM and resolve them using the redispatch algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concept of Redispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "The locational mismatch in demand and generation of electricity needs transmission of electricity from low demand regions to high demand regions. The transmission capacity limits the maximum amounts of electricity which can be transmitted at any point in time. If there is no enough capacity to transmit the required amount of electricity then there is a need of ramping down of generation at the locations of low demand and ramping up of generation at the locations of higher demand. This is typically called as Redispatch. Apart from spot markets there is redispatch mechanism to regulate this grid flows to avoid congestion issues. It is operated and controlled by the System operators (SO).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective \n",
    "The aim of redispatch is to reduce the overall cost of Redispatch(starting up, shutting down, ramping up, ramping down).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure in Redispatch model\n",
    "- The redispatch has following structure:\n",
    "    1. **Ramping up of reserved powerplants**:\n",
    "    2. **Ramping up of market powerplants**\n",
    "    2. **Ramping down of market powerplants**:\n",
    "    3. **Ramping up/down of other flexibilites**:"

    "In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1. Set up a **2-node** example of redispatch.\n",
    "2. Connect hypothetical **generators**,**loads** and **transmission lines** to illustrate flow of energy.\n",
    "3. Add **demand_side_units** to analyse their impact on overall redispatch.\n",
    "4. Simulate and visualize the results."
