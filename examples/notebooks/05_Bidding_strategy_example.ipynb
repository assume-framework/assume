    "# 5. Bidding Strategy tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the tutorial, we formulate a rule-based bidding strategy for the Electrolyser unit. Rule-based strategies guide the unit's market participation by following a predefined set of rules and guidelines, enabling it to make market offers autonomously.\n",
    "\n",

    "A rule-based bidding strategy is a set of algorithmic guidelines that dictate how a unit should participate in the electricity market. This is particularly important for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated Decision-making**: Allows the unit to make bids autonomously, reducing the need for human intervention.\n",
    "- **Market Adaptability**: Enables the unit to adjust its bidding behavior in response to dynamic market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components to consider to establish Rule-Based Bidding Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product Type**: This sets the stage for the kind of products (e.g., energy, ancillary services) that the unit will bid for in the electricity market.\n",
    "2. **Bid Volume**: The quantity of the product that the unit offers in its bid.\n",
    "3. **Marginal Revenue**: Used to determine the price at which the unit should make its bid. This involves calculating the unit's incremental revenue for additional units of electricity sold or consumed.\n"
