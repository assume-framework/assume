    "# 4.1 RL Algorithm tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce users into the MATD3 implementation in ASSUME and hence how we use reinforcement learning (RL). The main objective of this tutorial is to ensure participants grasp the steps required to equip ASSUME with a RL algorithm. It therefore starts one level deeper than the RL_application example and the knowledge from this tutorial is not required if the already pre-configured algorithm in Assume is to be used. The algorithm explained here is usable as a plug and play solution in the framework. The following coding snippets will highlight the key in the algorithm class and will explain the interactions with the learning role and other classes along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of this tutorial is as follows. We will start with an introduction to the changed simulation flow when we use reinforcement learning (1. From one simulation year to learning episodes). If you need a refresher on RL in general, please visit our readthedocs (https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Afterwards, we dive into the tasks and reason behind a learning role (2. What role has a learning role) and then dive into the characteristics of the algorithm (3. The MATD3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please Note:** The tutorial does not cover coding tasks. It simply provides an overview and explanation of the implementation of reinforcement learning and the flow for those who would like to modify the underlying learning algorithm.\n"

    "**Initialization of the Learning Process**: The function begins by setting up the environment, initializing policies, and configuring necessary settings such as logging and buffer allocation. It ensures that no existing policies are overwritten without confirmation.\n",

For each episode, the world simulation is completely re-initialized and reset after execution, meaning the simulation environment is essentially killed after each episode. Crucially, all necessary information that must persist across episodes—such as collected experience stored in the buffer—is maintained in the inter-episodic data. This data is key to ensuring the continuity of the learning process as it allows the DRL agents to build knowledge over time.\n",
