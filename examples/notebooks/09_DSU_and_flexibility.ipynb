    "In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of **Demand-Side Agents (DSA)** and their role in managing electricity consumption in response to price signals. The focus will be on modeling flexibility and performing **Power Flow Analysis** after clearing the day-ahead market. \n",
    "\n",
    "In modern electricity markets, **Demand-Side Management (DSM)** plays an essential role in ensuring efficient energy consumption, maintaining grid stability, and optimizing costs. Demand-side agents, such as industrial plants or residential units, can adjust their energy consumption in response to price signals from the electricity market. This capability to adapt energy usage in real-time provides **flexibility** that is crucial for balancing supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **ASSUME Framework**, demand-side agents are modeled as entities with specific energy requirements, flexibility capabilities, and interaction mechanisms in the market. These agents are able to:\n",
    "- **Participate in the electricity market** by submitting bids to purchase electricity based on their demand.\n",
    "- **Respond to price signals** to adjust their electricity consumption (flexibility).\n",
    "- **Perform load-shifting** by changing their consumption behavior in response to electricity prices, optimizing their costs while supporting grid operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Demand-Side Agents**: Entities that consume electricity, like industrial plants or households. These agents can adjust their consumption based on real-time market prices.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: The capability of an agent to adapt its electricity consumption, either by increasing or decreasing its load, in response to market conditions or price signals.\n",
    "3. **Power Flow Analysis**: After the day-ahead market clears, power flow analysis is conducted to ensure that electricity is distributed across the network in a manner that respects grid constraints and prevents congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration of the Characteristics of the Agent:\n",
    "- Each demand-side agent is modeled with **specific attributes** such as **rated power**, **minimum operating power**, and **flexibility measures**. These characteristics dictate how the agent behaves in the electricity market.\n",
    "- Agents can also be equipped with technologies like **electrolyser**, **DRI plant**, and **electric arc furnace**, each contributing to the agent’s overall power demand profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1. **Introduce how demand-side agents are modeled in the ASSUME framework**:\n",
    "   - We'll model a **steel plant** as a demand-side agent, including the specific characteristics such as rated power, minimum power, and flexibility settings.\n",
    "2. **Explore how flexibility is implemented**, allowing agents to shift their energy usage:\n",
    "   - We'll show how the steel plant can dynamically respond to market prices by adjusting its electricity consumption using predefined bidding strategies.\n",
    "3. **Model a steel plant as a demand-side agent** and simulate its participation in the electricity market:\n",
    "   - The steel plant will participate in the day-ahead market, submitting bids and optimizing its electricity consumption.\n",
    "4. **Integrate the characteristics and inputs of the steel plant agent**\n",
    "5. **Integrate in ASSUME**:\n",
    "   - We'll configure the **ASSUME framework**, setting up the market and integrating the steel plant agent for simulation. This will involve defining the market configuration, demand, supply, and load-shifting behaviors in response to price signals.\n",
    "6. **Analyze the results**:\n",
    "   - After running the simulation, we'll review how the steel plant performed in the electricity market. This will include analyzing energy consumption, bidding results, and flexibility behaviors.\n",
    "7. **Analyze grid congestion**:\n",
    "   - We'll perform a power flow analysis to evaluate how energy flows through the grid after the day-ahead market clears. We'll check for any grid congestion and determine how the demand-side agent’s behavior impacts the overall grid."

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal Operation**:\n",
    "    - The strategy first calculates the optimal operation of the steel plant using `unit.calculate_optimal_operation_if_needed()`. This ensures that the plant’s operational requirements are determined before submitting bids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bids Calculation**:\n",
    "    - For each time product (which represents a time period in the market), the strategy calculates:\n",
    "        - **Power requirement**: The volume of electricity the steel plant requires at the start of the time product, which is retrieved from `unit.opt_power_requirement.loc[start]`.\n",
    "        - **Marginal cost**: The marginal cost of producing this volume of electricity, calculated using `unit.calculate_marginal_cost(start, volume)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bid Structure**:\n",
    "    - The bid for each product includes:\n",
    "        - **Start time and end time** of the bid (the time window for which the bid applies).\n",
    "        - **Only hours**: The specific hours during which the bid applies.\n",
    "        - **Price**: The marginal cost of the electricity.\n",
    "        - **Volume**: The volume of electricity required, represented as a negative value since the steel plant is bidding to consume power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of the Bidding Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This bidding strategy allows the steel plant to participate in the **day-ahead electricity market** by submitting bids based on its **operational needs** and **marginal costs**.\n",
    "- The strategy ensures that the plant is optimizing its power consumption by submitting bids that reflect the **actual cost of production** and the **power requirements** for the upcoming time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy forms a core part of how the steel plant interacts with the market, balancing its electricity needs with the prices in the market. In the context of our simulation, this will be the default behavior for the steel plant when **flexibility** is not enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function: `calculate_marginal_cost`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bidding process, the **marginal cost** of the steel plant is calculated using the `calculate_marginal_cost` function. This function determines the **marginal cost** of producing electricity based on the required power at a specific time. The marginal cost is then used to submit bids in the day-ahead market."

    "\n",
    "#### `steel_plant_Day_Ahead`:\n",
    "- **start_date**: The start date and time for the simulation (**2019-01-01 00:00**).\n",
    "- **end_date**: The end date and time for the simulation (**2019-01-03 23:00**).\n",
    "- **time_step**: The simulation time step (**1h**), indicating hourly intervals.\n",
    "- **save_frequency_hours**: How frequently the simulation results are saved (**24 hours**).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `markets_config`:\n",
    "- **EOM**: The name of the market. Our power plant and demand units had a column named `bidding_EOM`, which associates them with this market. This configuration defines how this market operates.\n",
    "    - **operator**: The market operator (**EOM_operator**), responsible for managing the day-ahead market operations.\n",
    "    - **product_type**: The type of product traded in the market (**energy**), which indicates that energy is being traded in MWh.\n",
    "    - **products**: \n",
    "        - **duration**: Duration of the product (**1h**), meaning each product represents 1 hour of energy delivery.\n",
    "        - **count**: Number of products per day (**24**), representing the 24 hours in a day for which energy is traded.\n",
    "        - **first_delivery**: Specifies when the first energy delivery will occur (**1h** after the market opens).\n",
    "    - **opening_frequency**: How often the market opens (**24h**), indicating that the market opens once every day.\n",
    "    - **opening_duration**: The market stays open for **1 hour** every day, allowing participants to submit bids during this time.\n",
    "    - **volume_unit**: The unit of volume measurement in the market (**MWh**), representing megawatt-hours of electricity.\n",
    "    - **maximum_bid_volume**: The maximum volume allowed per bid (**100,000 MWh**), meaning no single bid can exceed this volume.\n",
    "    - **maximum_bid_price**: The highest price allowed per bid (**3,000 EUR/MWh**).\n",
    "    - **minimum_bid_price**: The lowest price allowed per bid (**-500 EUR/MWh**).\n",
    "    - **price_unit**: The unit of price measurement (**EUR/MWh**), indicating that prices are quoted in euros per megawatt-hour.\n",
    "    - **market_mechanism**: The clearing mechanism for the market (**pay_as_clear**), meaning all bids are cleared at the same price for all participants based on the marginal clearing price.\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration ensures that the simulation accurately represents the energy-only market (EOM) dynamics, including bid restrictions, price limits, and market operations. Each configuration parameter is designed to ensure that the market functions in a structured manner, reflecting real-world market behavior where energy is traded on an hourly basis."
