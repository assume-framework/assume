    "## 1. Introduction to Market Zone Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Zone Coupling** is a mechanism that enables different geographical zones within an electricity market to interact and trade energy seamlessly. In the ASSUME framework, implementing market zone coupling is straightforward: by properly defining the input data and configuration files, the framework automatically manages the interactions between zones, including transmission constraints and cross-zone trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims to provide a deeper understanding of how market zone coupling operates within ASSUME. While the framework handles much of the complexity internally, we will explore the underlying processes, such as the calculation of transmission capacities and the market clearing optimization. This detailed walkthrough is designed to enhance your comprehension of the framework's capabilities and the dynamics of multi-zone electricity markets.\n",

    "Throughout this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define Multiple Market Zones:** Segment the market into distinct zones based on geographical or operational criteria.\n",
    "- **Configure Transmission Lines:** Establish connections that allow energy flow between different market zones.\n",
    "- **Understand the Market Clearing Process:** Examine how the market clearing algorithm accounts for interactions and constraints across zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will not only know how to set up market zone coupling in ASSUME but also gain insights into the internal mechanisms that drive market interactions and price formations across different zones."

    "After running all three simulations, we can extract the results to understand how the presence or absence of transmission capacity affects bid acceptances and power flows between zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extracting Clearing Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The **clearing prices** for each market zone and time period are extracted using the dual variables associated with the energy balance constraints in the optimization model. Specifically, the dual variable of the energy balance constraint for a given zone and time period represents the marginal price of electricity in that zone at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `extract_results` function, the following steps are performed to obtain the clearing prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Energy Balance Constraints:** For each zone and time period, the energy balance equation ensures that the total supply plus imports minus exports equals the demand.\n",
    "2. **Dual Variables:** The dual variable (`model.dual[model.energy_balance[node, t]]`) associated with each energy balance constraint captures the sensitivity of the objective function (total cost) to a marginal increase in demand or supply.\n",
    "3. **Clearing Price Interpretation:** The value of the dual variable corresponds to the clearing price in the respective zone and time period, reflecting the cost of supplying an additional unit of electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method leverages the duality in optimization to efficiently extract market prices resulting from the optimal dispatch of bids under the given constraints."

    "2. **Market Clearing Optimization:**\n",
    "   - **Implemented Optimization Model:** Utilized a simplified Pyomo-based model to perform market clearing, accounting for bid acceptances and power flows.\n",
    "   - **Simulated Transmission Scenarios:** Ran simulations with varying transmission capacities to observe their impact on energy distribution and pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Result Analysis:**\n",
    "   - **Extracted Clearing Prices:** Retrieved and interpreted market prices from the optimization results.\n",
    "   - **Visualized Outcomes:** Created interactive plots to compare how different transmission capacities influence market dynamics across zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact of Transmission Capacity:** Transmission limits play a crucial role in determining energy flows and price convergence between market zones.\n",
    "- **ASSUME Framework Efficiency:** ASSUME streamlines complex market simulations, making it easier to model and analyze multi-zone interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrate Renewable Sources:** Expand the model to include renewable energy units and assess their impact on market dynamics.\n",
    "- **Scale Up Simulations:** Apply the framework to larger, more complex market scenarios to further test its capabilities.\n",
