    "In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of **Demand-Side Agents (DSA)** and their role in managing electricity consumption in response to price signals. The focus will be on modeling flexibility and performing **Power Flow Analysis** after clearing the day-ahead market. \n",
    "\n",
    "In modern electricity markets, **Demand-Side Management (DSM)** plays an essential role in ensuring efficient energy consumption, maintaining grid stability, and optimizing costs. Demand-side agents, such as industrial plants or residential units, can adjust their energy consumption in response to price signals from the electricity market. This capability to adapt energy usage in real-time provides **flexibility** that is crucial for balancing supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **ASSUME Framework**, demand-side agents are modeled as entities with specific energy requirements, flexibility capabilities, and interaction mechanisms in the market. These agents are able to:\n",
    "- **Participate in the electricity market** by submitting bids to purchase electricity based on their demand.\n",
    "- **Respond to price signals** to adjust their electricity consumption (flexibility).\n",
    "- **Perform load-shifting** by changing their consumption behavior in response to electricity prices, optimizing their costs while supporting grid operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Demand-Side Agents**: Entities that consume electricity, like industrial plants or households. These agents can adjust their consumption based on real-time market prices.\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: The capability of an agent to adapt its electricity consumption, either by increasing or decreasing its load, in response to market conditions or price signals.\n",
    "3. **Power Flow Analysis**: After the day-ahead market clears, power flow analysis is conducted to ensure that electricity is distributed across the network in a manner that respects grid constraints and prevents congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration of the Characteristics of the Agent:\n",
    "- Each demand-side agent is modeled with **specific attributes** such as **rated power**, **minimum operating power**, and **flexibility measures**. These characteristics dictate how the agent behaves in the electricity market.\n",
    "- Agents can also be equipped with technologies like **electrolyser**, **DRI plant**, and **electric arc furnace**, each contributing to the agent’s overall power demand profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "1. **Introduce how demand-side agents are modeled in the ASSUME framework**:\n",
    "   - We'll model a **steel plant** as a demand-side agent, including the specific characteristics such as rated power, minimum power, and flexibility settings.\n",
    "2. **Explore how flexibility is implemented**, allowing agents to shift their energy usage:\n",
    "   - We'll show how the steel plant can dynamically respond to market prices by adjusting its electricity consumption using predefined bidding strategies.\n",
    "3. **Model a steel plant as a demand-side agent** and simulate its participation in the electricity market:\n",
    "   - The steel plant will participate in the day-ahead market, submitting bids and optimizing its electricity consumption.\n",
    "4. **Integrate the characteristics and inputs of the steel plant agent**\n",
    "5. **Integrate in ASSUME**:\n",
    "   - We'll configure the **ASSUME framework**, setting up the market and integrating the steel plant agent for simulation. This will involve defining the market configuration, demand, supply, and load-shifting behaviors in response to price signals.\n",
    "6. **Analyze the results**:\n",
    "   - After running the simulation, we'll review how the steel plant performed in the electricity market. This will include analyzing energy consumption, bidding results, and flexibility behaviors.\n",
    "7. **Analyze grid congestion**:\n",
    "   - We'll perform a power flow analysis to evaluate how energy flows through the grid after the day-ahead market clears. We'll check for any grid congestion and determine how the demand-side agent’s behavior impacts the overall grid."
