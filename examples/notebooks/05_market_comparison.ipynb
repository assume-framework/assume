    "Yet, the reality includes a lot more than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase that ASSUME can handle scenarios with multiple markets as well, a scenario is created where a long term bidding of 7 days takes place before the day-ahead market.\n",
    "The pricing mechanism for this long-term market is pay-as-bid while the day ahead market uses uniform pricing/pay-as-clear.\n",
