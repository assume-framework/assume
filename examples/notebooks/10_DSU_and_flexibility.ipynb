    "\n",
    "In modern electricity markets, **Demand-Side Management (DSM)** plays an essential role in ensuring efficient energy consumption, maintaining grid stability, and optimizing costs. Demand-side agents, such as industrial plants or residential units, can adjust their energy consumption in response to price signals from the electricity market. This capability to adapt energy usage in real-time provides **flexibility** that is crucial for balancing supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **ASSUME Framework**, demand-side agents are modeled as entities with specific energy requirements, flexibility capabilities, and interaction mechanisms in the market. These agents are able to:\n",
    "- Participate in electricity markets by bidding to buy electricity based on demand.\n",
    "- Adjust their consumption based on price signals (flexibility).\n",
    "- Perform load-shifting to optimize costs while supporting grid stability\n",

    "**Integration of the Characteristics of the Agent:**\n",
    "- Each demand-side agent is modeled with **specific attributes** such as **rated power**, **minimum operating power**, and **flexibility measures**. These characteristics dictate how the agent behaves in the electricity market.\n",
    "- Agents can also be equipped with technologies like **electrolyser**, **DRI plant**, and **electric arc furnace**, each contributing to the agentâ€™s overall power demand profile.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Introduce how demand-side agents are modeled in the **ASSUME** framework.\n",

    "- Power flow analysis and grid congestion management.\n",
    "- Simulate a **steel plant** as a demand-side agent, participating in various market conditions.\n",
    "- Analyze three use cases of the steel plant's participation in the electricity market:\n",
    "  - **Use Case 1**: Simulation without flexibility.\n",

    "- *Bids Calculation*:\n",
    "    - For each time product (which represents a time period in the market), the strategy calculates:\n",
    "        - **Power requirement**: The volume of electricity the steel plant requires at the start of the time product, which is retrieved from `unit.opt_power_requirement.loc[start]`.\n",
    "        - **Marginal cost**: The marginal cost of producing this volume of electricity, calculated using `unit.calculate_marginal_cost(start, volume)`.\n",

    "        - **Price**: The marginal cost of the electricity.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role of the Bidding Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This bidding strategy allows the steel plant to participate in the **day-ahead electricity market** by submitting bids based on its **operational needs** and **marginal costs**.\n",
    "- The strategy ensures that the plant is optimizing its power consumption by submitting bids that reflect the **actual cost of production** and the **power requirements** for the upcoming time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy forms a core part of how the steel plant interacts with the market, balancing its electricity needs with the prices in the market. In the context of our simulation, this will be the default behavior for the steel plant when **flexibility** is not enabled.\n",

    "- Power plants first participate in the **day-ahead market (EOM)** to optimize their electricity production.\n",

    "1. **Creating a new market configuration** that includes both the **day-ahead market (EOM)** and the **Redispatch** market.\n",
