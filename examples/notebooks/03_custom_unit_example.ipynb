    "In the following figure the architecture of the framework is depicted. It can be roughly devided into two parts. On the left side, we have the market elements, and on the right side, we have the market participants, which we'll call 'units' here. These two parts are connected because the market participants make orders in the markets. Now, there's something special on the right side, shown in yellow. That's where we talk about the framework's ability to learn and adapt. But before we dive into all the technical details of ASSUME, let's first get familiar with some important terms and concepts that are the building blocks of electricity market modeling."
