    "This flowchart provides an overview of the key stages involved in the run_learning function, which trains Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents within a simulated market environment. The process is divided into five main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization of the Learning Process**: The function begins by setting up the environment, initializing policies, and configuring necessary settings such as logging and buffer allocation. It ensures that no existing policies are overwritten without confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Loop**: This is the outer loop where multiple training episodes are executed. For each episode, the world simulation is completely re-initialized and reset after execution, meaning the simulation environment is essentially killed after each episode. Crucially, all necessary information that must persist across episodes—such as collected experience stored in the buffer—is maintained in the inter-episodic data. This data is key to ensuring the continuity of the learning process as it allows the DRL agents to build knowledge over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation Loop**: Nested within the training loop, the evaluation loop periodically assesses the performance of the learned policies. Based on average rewards, the best-performing policies are saved, and the function determines if further training is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Terminate Learning**: At the end of the training phase, the function saves the final version of the learned policies, ensuring that the results are stored for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Evaluation Run**: A final evaluation run is conducted using the best policies from the training phase, providing a benchmark for overall performance.\n",

    "The LearningRole class in learning_role.py is a central component of the reinforcement learning framework. It manages configurations, device settings, early stopping of the learning process, and initializes various RL strategies, the algorithm and buffers. This class ensures that the RL agent can be trained or evaluated effectively, leveraging the available hardware and adhering to the specified configurations. The parameters of the learning process are also described in the read-the-docs under learning_algorithms.\n",
