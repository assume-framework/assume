    "Let's focus on the bright yellow part of the architecture, namely the learning algorithm, the actor and the critic. We start with some **reinforcement learning backround**. In the current implementation of ASSUME, we model the electricity market as a partially observable Markov game, which is an extension of MDPs for multi-agent setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-agent DRL** is understood as the simultaneous learning of multiple agents interacting in the same environment. The Markov game for $N$ agents consists of a set of states $S$, a set of actions $A_1, ..., A_N$, a set of observations $O_1, ..., O_N$, and a state transition function $P: S \\times A_1 \\times ... \\times A_N \\rightarrow \\mathcal{P}(S)$ dependent on the state and actions of all agents. After taking action $a_i \\in A_i$ in state $s_i \\in S$ according to a policy $\\pi_i:O_i\\rightarrow A_i$, every agent $i$ is transitioned into the new state $s'_i \\in S$. Each agent receives a reward $r_i$ according to the individual reward function $R_i$ and a private observation correlated with the state $o_i:S \\rightarrow O_i$. Like MDP, each agent $i$ learns an optimal policy $\\pi_i^*(s)$ that maximizes its expected reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable multi-agent learning some adjustments are needed within the learning algorithm to get from the TD3 to an MATD3 algorithm. Other authors used similar tweaks to improve the TD3 into the MADDPG algorithm and derive the MA-TD3 algorithm. We'll start explaining the learning by focusing on a single agent and then extend it to multi-agent learning."

The actor network is responsible for selecting actions, while the critic network evaluates the quality of the actions taken by the actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actor and critic networks are trained simultaneously using the actor-critic algorithm, which updates the weights of both networks at each time step.

    "### Multi-Agent Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "While in a single-agent setup, the state transition and respective reward depend only on the actions of a single agent, the state transitions and rewards depend on the actions of all learning agents in a multi-agent setup. This makes the environment non-stationary for a single agent, which violates the Markov property. Hence, the convergence guarantees of single-agent RL algorithms are no longer valid. Therefore, we utilize the framework of centralized training and decentralized execution and expand upon the MADDPG algorithm. The main idea of this approach is to use a centralized critic during the training phase, which has access to the entire state $\\textbf{S}$, and all actions $a_1, ..., a_N$, thus resolving the issue of non-stationarity, as changes in state transitions and rewards can be explained by the actions of other agents. Meanwhile, during both training and execution, the actor has access only to its local observations $o_i$ derived from the entire state $\\textbf{S}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each agent $i$, we train two centralized critics $Q_{i,θ_1,2}(S, a_1, ..., a_N)$  together with two target critic networks. Similar to TD3, the smaller value of the two critics and target action noise $a_i$,$k~$ is used to calculate the target $y_i,k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_i,k = r_i,k + γ * min_j=1,2 Q_i,θ′_j(S′_k, a_1,k, ..., a_N,k, π′(o_i,k))$\n",

    "where $r_i,k$ is the reward obtained by agent $i$ at time step $k$, $γ$ is the discount factor, $S′_k$ is the next state of the environment, and $π′(o_i,k)$ is the target policy of agent $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critics are trained using the mean squared Bellman error (MSBE) loss:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(Q_i,θ_j) = E[(y_i,k - Q_i,θ_j(S_k, a_1,k, ..., a_N,k))^2]$\n",

    "\n",
    "The actor is updated similarly using only one critic network $Q_{θ1}$. These changes to the original DDPG algorithm allow increased stability and convergence of the TD3 algorithm. This is especially relevant when approaching a multi-agent RL setup, as discussed in the following section."

    "The decision about the observations received by each agent plays a crucial role when designing a multi-agent RL setup. The following describes the task of learning agents representing profit-maximizing electricity market participants who either sell a generating unit's output or optimize a storage unit's operation. They are represented through their plants' techno-economic parameters, such as minimal operational capacity $P^{min}$, start-up $c^{su}$, and shut-down $c^{sd}$ costs. This information is all know by the unit istself and, hence, also accessible in the bidding strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training phase, the centralized critic receives observations from all agents, resulting in an input size that grows linearly with the number of agents. This can lead to unstable training behavior of the critic networks, which limits the maximal number of agents in the simulation. This effect is known as the dimensionality curse, which likely contributed to the small number of learning agents in existing approaches. To address the dimensionality curse, we use a single observation that is the same for all agents and added a small size of unique observations for each agent to improve their performance. This modification allows the use of only one observation in the centralized critic, decoupled from the number of learning agents, significantly reducing the observation size and enabling simultaneous training of hundreds of learning agents with stable training behavior. The only limiting factor is the available working memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "At time-step $t$, agent $i$ receives the observation $o_{i,t}$ consisting of vectors $[L_{\\mathrm{h},t}, L_{\\mathrm{f},t}, M_{\\mathrm{h},t}, M_{\\mathrm{f},t}, mc_{i,t}]$. Here $L_{\\mathrm{h},t}, L_{\\mathrm{f},t}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{h},t}, M_{\\mathrm{f},t}$ are the past and the forecast residual loads and market prices, respectively. These information stems from the world, where a overall forecasting role generates them. The price forecast is calculated ahead of the simulation run using a simple merit order model based on the residual load forecast and the marginal cost of power plants. This part of the observation is the same for all agents. In addition, each agent receives its current marginal cost $mc_{i,t}$. Information about the marginal cost is shared with a centralized critic during the training phase. Still, it is not shared with other agents during the execution phase. All the inputs are normalized to improve the performance of the training process.\n"

    "\n",
    "First why do we scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling observations is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning, including reinforcement learning. It involves transforming the features so that they all fall within a similar numerical range. This is important for several reasons. Firstly, it aids in numerical stability during training. Large input values can lead to numerical precision issues, potentially causing the algorithm to perform poorly or even fail to converge. By scaling the features, we mitigate this risk, ensuring a more stable and reliable learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, scaling promotes uniformity in the learning process. Many optimization algorithms, like gradient descent, adjust model parameters based on the magnitude of gradients. When features have vastly different scales, some may dominate the learning process, while others receive less attention. This imbalance can hinder convergence and result in a suboptimal model. Scaling addresses this issue, allowing the algorithm to treat all features equally and progress more efficiently towards an optimal solution. This not only expedites the learning process but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In essence, scaling observations is a fundamental practice that enhances the performance and robustness of machine learning models across a wide array of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this the scaling should ensure a similar range for all input parameteres. You can achieve that by chosing the following scaling factors. If you add new observations, choose your scaling factors wisely."

    "To differentiate between the inflexible and flexible parts of a plant's generation capacity, we split the bids into two parts. The first bid part allows agents to bid a very low or even negative price for the inflexible capacity; this reflects the agent's motivation to stay infra-marginal during periods of very low net load (e.g., in periods of high solar and wind power generation) to avoid the cost of a shut-down and subsequent start-up of the plant. The flexible part of the capacity can be offered at a higher price to provide chances for higher profits. The actions of agent $i$ at time-step $t$ are defined as $a_{i,t} = [ep^\\mathrm{inflex}_{i,t}, ep^\\mathrm{flex}_{i,t}] \\in [ep^{min},ep^{max}]$, where $ep^\\mathrm{inflex}_{i,t}$ and $ep^\\mathrm{flex}_{i,t}$ are bid prices for the inflexible and flexible capacities, and $ep^{min},ep^{max}$ are minimal and maximal bid prices, respectively.\n",

    "How do we learn, how to make good decisions? Basically by try and error, also know as **exploration**. Exploration is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning, representing the strategy by which an agent interacts with its environment to gather information about the consequences of its actions. This is crucial because without exploration, the agent might settle for suboptimal policies based on its initial knowledge, limiting its ability to discover more rewarding states or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial stages of training, also often called initial exploration, it's imperative to employ almost random actions. This means having the agent take actions purely by chance. This seemingly counterintuitive approach serves a critical purpose. Initially, the agent lacks any meaningful information about the environment, making it impossible to make informed decisions. By taking random actions, it can quickly gather a broad range of experiences, allowing it to grasp the fundamental structure of the environment. These random actions serve as a kind of \"baseline exploration,\" providing a starting point from which the agent can refine its policy through learning. With our domain knowledge we can even guide the initial exploration process, to enhance learning capabilities.\n",

At a point close to the equilibrium point, the average reward of all agents would converge to a constant value since further policy changes would not lead to an additional reduction in regrets or an increase in profits. Therefore, the average reward value can also be a good indicator of learning performance and convergence."
