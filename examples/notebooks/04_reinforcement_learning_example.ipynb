    "# 4.2 Reinforcement learning tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will introduce users into ASSUME and its ways of using reinforcement learning (RL). The main objective of this tutorial is to ensure participants grasp the steps required to equip a new unit with RL strategies or modify the action dimensions.\n",
    "Our emphasis lies in the bidding strategy, with less focus on the algorithm and role. The latter are usable as a plug-and-play solution in the framework. The following coding tasks will highlight the key aspects to be adjusted, as already outlined in the learning_strategies.py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outline of this tutorial is as follows. We will start with a basic summary of the implementation of reinforcement learning (RL) in ASSUME and its architecture (1. ASSUME & Learning Basics).  A brief refresher is also given in this exercise. If you need a more thorough refresher on RL in general, please visit our readthedocs ([Reinforcement Learning Overview](https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learning/) & [Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learning_algorithm.html)). Afterwards, we install ASSUME in this Google Colab (2. Get ASSUME running) and then we dive into the learning_strategies.py file and explain how we need to adjust conventional bidding strategies to incorporate RL (3. Make ASSUME learn).\n",

    "1. How to define a step function in the ASSUME framework.\n",

    "2. How do we get observations from the simulation framework.\n",

    "Let's focus on the bright yellow part of the architecture, namely the learning algorithm, the actor and the critic. We start with some **reinforcement learning background**. In the current implementation of ASSUME, we model the electricity market as a partially observable Markov game, which is an extension of MDPs for multi-agent setups. Following, a brief summary of the more detailed documentation on [Reinforcement Learning](https://assume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learning/) is provided.\n",

    "**Multi-agent DRL** involves multiple agents learning simultaneously while interacting in the same environment. In a Markov game, agents exist in a set of states and can take actions, receive observations, and transition between states. Each agent follows a policy aimed at maximizing its expected reward based on individual reward functions and private observations.\n",

    "### Single-Agent Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach uses an actor-critic method with two neural networks: an actor network and a critic network. The actor network selects actions, while the critic network evaluates the quality of those actions. Both networks are trained simultaneously through an iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actor**:  \n",
    "The actor network is trained using a policy gradient method. It updates its weights to maximize the expected reward by adjusting the probability of selecting specific actions in given states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critic**:  \n",
    "The critic network is trained using temporal difference (TD) learning. It estimates the value of states by comparing the current state's estimated value with the next state's estimated value, updating its weights based on the difference (TD error).\n",

    "### Multi-Agent Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multi-agent setup, state transitions and rewards depend on the actions of all learning agents, unlike single-agent scenarios. This creates a non-stationary environment that violates the Markov property, invalidating traditional single-agent reinforcement learning convergence guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this challenge, the approach uses a centralized training and decentralized execution framework, expanding on the MADDPG algorithm. During training, a centralized critic has access to the entire state and all agents' actions, which helps explain state transition changes. However, during both training and execution, each agent's actor uses only its local observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each agent, two centralized critics are trained alongside target critic networks to address Overestimation Bias. Similar to TD3, the approach uses the smaller value of two critics and adds target action noise to calculate the target value. The critics are trained using the mean squared Bellman error loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actor policy for each agent is updated using the deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Each actor uses only one critic network to update its policy. These modifications to the original DDPG algorithm aim to increase stability and convergence, particularly in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios.\n",
    "The key innovation is enabling agents to learn effectively in complex, interactive environments by using centralized information during training while maintaining decentralized decision-making during execution.\n"

    "### 3.2 Get an observation\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision about the observations received by each agent plays a crucial role when designing a multi-agent RL setup. The following describes the task of learning agents representing profit-maximizing electricity market participants who either sell a generating unit's output or optimize a storage unit's operation. They are represented through their plants' techno-economic parameters, such as minimal operational capacity $P^{min}$, start-up $c^{su}$, and shut-down $c^{sd}$ costs. This information is all know by the unit itself and, hence, also accessible in the bidding strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training phase, the centralized critic receives observations from all agents, resulting in an input size that grows linearly with the number of agents. This can lead to unstable training behavior of the critic networks, which limits the maximal number of agents in the simulation. This effect is known as the dimensionality curse, which likely contributed to the small number of learning agents in existing approaches. To address the dimensionality curse, we use a single observation that is the same for all agents and add a small size of unique observations for each agent to improve their performance. This modification allows the use of only one observation in the centralized critic, decoupled from the number of learning agents, significantly reducing the observation size and enabling simultaneous training of hundreds of learning agents with stable training behavior. The only limiting factor is the available working memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "At time-step $t$, agent $i$ receives the observation $o_{i,t}$ consisting of vectors $[L_{\\mathrm{h},t}, L_{\\mathrm{f},t}, M_{\\mathrm{h},t}, M_{\\mathrm{f},t}, mc_{i,t}]$. Here $L_{\\mathrm{h},t}, L_{\\mathrm{f},t}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{h},t}, M_{\\mathrm{f},t}$ are the past and the forecast residual loads and market prices, respectively. This information stems from the world, where an overall forecasting role generates them. The price forecast is calculated ahead of the simulation run using a simple merit order model based on the residual load forecast and the marginal cost of power plants. This part of the observation is the same for all agents. In addition, each agent receives its current marginal cost $mc_{i,t}$. Information about the marginal cost is shared with a centralized critic during the training phase. Still, it is not shared with other agents during the execution phase. All the inputs are normalized to improve the performance of the training process.\n"

    "\n",
    "First why do we scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling observations is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning, including reinforcement learning. It involves transforming the features so that they all fall within a similar numerical range. This is important for several reasons. Firstly, it aids in numerical stability during training. Large input values can lead to numerical precision issues, potentially causing the algorithm to perform poorly or even fail to converge. By scaling the features, we mitigate this risk, ensuring a more stable and reliable learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, scaling promotes uniformity in the learning process. Many optimization algorithms, like gradient descent, adjust model parameters based on the magnitude of gradients. When features have vastly different scales, some may dominate the learning process, while others receive less attention. This imbalance can hinder convergence and result in a suboptimal model. Scaling addresses this issue, allowing the algorithm to treat all features equally and progress more efficiently towards an optimal solution. This not only expedites the learning process but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In essence, scaling observations is a fundamental practice that enhances the performance and robustness of machine learning models across a wide array of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to this, the scaling should ensure a similar range for all input parameters. You can achieve that by choosing the following scaling factors. If you add new observations, choose your scaling factors wisely."

    "To differentiate between the inflexible and flexible parts of a plant's generation capacity, we split the bids into two parts. The first bid part allows agents to bid a very low or even negative price for the inflexible capacity; this reflects the agent's motivation to stay infra-marginal during periods of very low net load (e.g., in periods of high solar and wind power generation) to avoid the cost of a shut-down and subsequent start-up of the plant. The flexible part of the capacity can be offered at a higher price to provide chances for higher profits. The actions of agent $i$ at time-step $t$ are defined as $a_{i,t} = [ep^\\mathrm{inflex}_{i,t}, ep^\\mathrm{flex}_{i,t}] \\in [ep^{min},ep^{max}]$, where $ep^\\mathrm{inflex}_{i,t}$ and $ep^\\mathrm{flex}_{i,t}$ are bid prices for the inflexible and flexible capacities, and $ep^{min},ep^{max}$ are minimal and maximal bid prices, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we learn, how to make good decisions? Basically by try and error, also know as **exploration**. Exploration is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning, representing the strategy by which an agent interacts with its environment to gather information about the consequences of its actions. This is crucial because without exploration, the agent might settle for suboptimal policies based on its initial knowledge, limiting its ability to discover more rewarding states or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the initial stages of training, also often called initial exploration, it's imperative to employ almost random actions. This means having the agent take actions purely by chance. This seemingly counterintuitive approach serves a critical purpose. Initially, the agent lacks any meaningful information about the environment, making it impossible to make informed decisions. By taking random actions, it can quickly gather a broad range of experiences, allowing it to grasp the fundamental structure of the environment. These random actions serve as a kind of \"baseline exploration,\" providing a starting point from which the agent can refine its policy through learning. With our domain knowledge we can even guide the initial exploration process, to enhance learning capabilities.\n",

    "This step is done in the `calculate_reward()`-function, which is called after the market is cleared and we get the market feedback, so we can calculate the profit. In RL, the design of a reward function is as important as the choice of the correct algorithm. During the initial phase of the work, pure economic reward in the form of the agent's profit was used. Typically, electricity market models consider only a single restart cost. Still, in the case of using RL, the split into shut-down and start-up costs allow the agents to better differentiate between these two events and learn a better policy.\n",
