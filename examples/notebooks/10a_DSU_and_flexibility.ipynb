    "# 10a. Modeling Demand-Side Units and Flexibility in the ASSUME Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the ASSUME DSM Workshop!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on tutorial, we will explore how to model **Demand-Side Units (DSU)** and unlock their **flexibility potential** in electricity market simulations using the **ASSUME** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Demand-Side Flexibility in Electricity Markets?\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s electricity system, **Demand-Side Management (DSM)**, units help maintain physical balance and grid stability especially as more renewables increase variability and uncertainty. At the same time, in the market context, DSM enables consumers to respond to price signals, actively manage their costs, and help prevent price spikes caused by scarcity or inflexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demand-side flexibility** enables:\n",
    "- **Dynamic adaptation to price signals:** Units can increase or decrease consumption when electricity prices change, helping to flatten peaks and fill valleys in demand.\n",
    "- **Grid congestion management:** DSM can be activated as a targeted resource in congested network areas, helping system operators alleviate bottlenecks without costly grid reinforcements.\n",
    "- **Efficient market operations:** By shifting demand in response to market conditions, DSM units can help avoid costly price spikes and reduce the need for expensive reserve generation.\n",
    "- **Integration of renewables:** Flexible demand can absorb excess renewable energy when supply is high and reduce consumption when supply is tight, supporting grid stability.\n",
    "- **New revenue streams for consumers:** By offering flexibility as a market product (e.g., via reserve or capacity markets), DSM units can generate additional value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ASSUME framework, **DSM units are explicitly modeled to interact with market mechanisms submitting bids, responding to electricity prices, and providing upward/downward regulation.** This allows us to analyze both the *technical* and *economic* impact of flexibility in realistic market environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Demand-Side Unit (DSU) in ASSUME?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **DSU** in ASSUME is a *demand side agent* representing an industrial plant, building, or flexible consumer, modeled with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technology composition**: (e.g., heat pumps, boilers, electrolyzers, battery storage)\n",
    "- **Technical constraints**: (e.g., rated/min/max power, storage capacity, ramp rates)\n",
    "- **Market participation logic**: Ability to submit bids, react to prices, and optimize their operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "DSUs in ASSUME can act as:\n",
    "- **Passive demand**: Consuming electricity as per a fixed profile.\n",
    "- **Active agents**: Shaping their demand by responding to external signals, thus providing *flexibility*.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Will We Learn in This Tutorial?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will guide you through the **step-by-step modeling and simulation** of DSUs, focusing on how *flexibility* is implemented and utilized in ASSUME. Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how DSUs can be modeled and implemented in ASSUME.\n",
    "- Explore various DSM unit types available in ASSUME (e.g., Building, Hydrogen Plant, Steam Plant) and their key modeling attributes.\n",
    "- Apply multiple flexibility measures to DSM units, including customizing your own.\n",
    "- Integrate market bidding strategies and see how agents can monetize flexibility.\n",
    "- Integrate flexibility in the market.\n",
    "- Simulate and analyze a real use case: *investment decision-making for a flexible industrial plant under market uncertainty.*\n",

    "### From Flexibility to Market Participation\n",
    "\n",
    "After optimizing the flexibility of a DSM unit, the next essential step is to make this flexibility **profitable** by participating in electricity markets. This is achieved through **bidding strategies** algorithms that translate physical flexibility into concrete market offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In ASSUME, bidding strategies:**\n",
    "- Enable DSM units to submit bids to electricity markets (e.g., day-ahead, balancing, or reserve).\n",
    "- Respect market requirements (block length, symmetry, minimum bid size, etc.).\n",
    "- Link the physical flexibility (from optimization) to actual, revenue-generating market products.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separation of concerns:** The DSM agent determines “what is possible” physically; the bidding strategy decides “how to sell it in the market.”\n",
    "- **Market products:** Most reserve and flexibility markets operate on block-based products (e.g., 4-hour symmetric CRM blocks in Germany).\n",
    "- **Plug & play:** You can switch or test different strategies without rewriting the core agent logic.\n",

    "#### Bidding into the Day-Ahead Market with DSM Units\n",
    "\n",
    "DSM agents in ASSUME can participate not only in reserve markets (CRM) but also directly in the energy market. In the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), bids are created by mapping the agent's optimized operation profile to market orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bid Volume:** The optimized (scheduled) load at each time step.\n",
    "- **Bid Price:** The marginal cost of the unit at that time (or a user-defined price).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enables DSM units to monetize their flexibility in the core energy market, not just as reserves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we demonstrate how to use the `NaiveDADSMStrategy` to create DAM bids from a DSM plant's optimized operation."

    "- We simulate two configurations (\"Electrolyser\" and \"Electrolyser+Storage\") under two market scenarios (Stable CO₂ and Volatile CO₂).\n",
    "- For each, we calculate the total annual electricity cost for producing 500 MWh *scaled up* to 365 days (i.e., 500 MWh × 73 = 36,500 MWh/year).\n",

    "- We assume subjective probabilities for each market scenario (e.g., 0.4 for Stable, 0.6 for Volatile).\n",
    "- Utilities are normalized to [0,1] (lower cost = higher utility).\n",
