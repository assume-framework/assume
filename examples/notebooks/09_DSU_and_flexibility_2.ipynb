    "In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of **Demand-Side Agents (DSA)** and their role in managing electricity consumption in response to price signals. The focus will be on modeling flexibility and performing **Power Flow Analysis** after clearing the day-ahead market. \n",
    "\n",
    "In modern electricity markets, **Demand-Side Management (DSM)** plays an essential role in ensuring efficient energy consumption, maintaining grid stability, and optimizing costs. Demand-side agents, such as industrial plants or residential units, can adjust their energy consumption in response to price signals from the electricity market. This capability to adapt energy usage in real-time provides **flexibility** that is crucial for balancing supply and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **ASSUME Framework**, demand-side agents are modeled as entities with specific energy requirements, flexibility capabilities, and interaction mechanisms in the market. These agents are able to:\n",
    "- Participate in electricity markets by bidding to buy electricity based on demand.\n",
    "- Adjust their consumption based on price signals (flexibility).\n",
    "- Perform load-shifting to optimize costs while supporting grid stability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration of the Characteristics of the Agent:\n",
    "- Each demand-side agent is modeled with **specific attributes** such as **rated power**, **minimum operating power**, and **flexibility measures**. These characteristics dictate how the agent behaves in the electricity market.\n",
    "- Agents can also be equipped with technologies like **electrolyser**, **DRI plant**, and **electric arc furnace**, each contributing to the agent’s overall power demand profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this tutorial, we will:\n",
    "- Introduce how demand-side agents are modeled in the **ASSUME** framework.\n",
    "- Explore how flexibility is implemented for agents to shift energy usage.\n",
    "- Power flow analysis and grid congestion management.\n",
    "- Simulate a **steel plant** as a demand-side agent, participating in various market conditions.\n",
    "- Analyze three use cases of the steel plant's participation in the electricity market:\n",
    "  - **Use Case 1**: Simulation without flexibility.\n",
    "  - **Use Case 2**: Simulation with flexibility.\n",
    "  - **Use Case 3**: Simulation with power plants participating in redispatch markets."

    "    - The strategy first calculates the optimal operation of the steel plant using `unit.calculate_optimal_operation_if_needed()`. This ensures that the plant’s operational requirements are determined before submitting bids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Bids Calculation*:\n",
    "    - For each time product (which represents a time period in the market), the strategy calculates:\n",
    "        - **Power requirement**: The volume of electricity the steel plant requires at the start of the time product, which is retrieved from `unit.opt_power_requirement.loc[start]`.\n",
    "        - **Marginal cost**: The marginal cost of producing this volume of electricity, calculated using `unit.calculate_marginal_cost(start, volume)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Bid Structure*:\n",
    "    - The bid for each product includes:\n",
    "        - **Start time and end time** of the bid (the time window for which the bid applies).\n",
    "        - **Only hours**: The specific hours during which the bid applies.\n",
    "        - **Price**: The marginal cost of the electricity.\n",
    "        - **Volume**: The volume of electricity required, represented as a negative value since the steel plant is bidding to consume power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role of the Bidding Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This bidding strategy allows the steel plant to participate in the **day-ahead electricity market** by submitting bids based on its **operational needs** and **marginal costs**.\n",
    "- The strategy ensures that the plant is optimizing its power consumption by submitting bids that reflect the **actual cost of production** and the **power requirements** for the upcoming time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy forms a core part of how the steel plant interacts with the market, balancing its electricity needs with the prices in the market. In the context of our simulation, this will be the default behavior for the steel plant when **flexibility** is not enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function: `calculate_marginal_cost`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the bidding process, the **marginal cost** of the steel plant is calculated using the `calculate_marginal_cost` function. This function determines the **marginal cost** of producing electricity based on the required power at a specific time. The marginal cost is then used to submit bids in the day-ahead market."

    "- **end_date**: The end date and time for the simulation (**2019-01-03 23:00**).\n",
    "- **time_step**: The simulation time step (**1h**), indicating hourly intervals.\n",
    "- **save_frequency_hours**: How frequently the simulation results are saved (**24 hours**).\n",

    "#### `markets_config`:\n",
    "- **EOM**: The name of the market. Our power plant and demand units had a column named `bidding_EOM`, which associates them with this market. This configuration defines how this market operates.\n",
    "    - **operator**: The market operator (**EOM_operator**), responsible for managing the day-ahead market operations.\n",

    "    - **opening_frequency**: How often the market opens (**24h**), indicating that the market opens once every day.\n",
    "    - **opening_duration**: The market stays open for **1 hour** every day, allowing participants to submit bids during this time.\n",
    "    - **volume_unit**: The unit of volume measurement in the market (**MWh**), representing megawatt-hours of electricity.\n",
    "    - **maximum_bid_volume**: The maximum volume allowed per bid (**100,000 MWh**), meaning no single bid can exceed this volume.\n",
    "    - **maximum_bid_price**: The highest price allowed per bid (**3,000 EUR/MWh**).\n",
