    "# 4.2 Designing Adaptive Bidding Strategies in ASSUME using Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the integration of **reinforcement learning (RL)** into the **ASSUME** simulation framework, with a focus on developing and deploying learning-based bidding strategies for electricity market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is designed to walk you through the essential components required to transform a conventional market participant into an RL agent. Rather than concentrating on the underlying algorithmic infrastructure—such as training loops, buffers, or learning roles—this tutorial emphasizes **how to define a bidding strategy that interfaces with the ASSUME learning backend**. You will learn how to construct observation spaces, define action mappings, and design reward functions that guide agent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each core concept is addressed in a dedicated chapter, accompanied by exercises that allow you to apply the material directly. These hands-on tasks culminate in a final integration chapter where you will run a complete simulation and train your first learning agent.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Single-Agent RL\n",
    "\n",
    "In a single-agent setup, the agent attempts to maximize its reward over time by learning from interaction with the environment. It does so by making multiple steps in the environment. In RL, each interaction step includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observation** of the current state.\n",
    "2. **Action** selection based on policy.\n",
    "3. **Reward** from the environment.\n",

    "**Actor-Critic Structure:**\n",
    "To increase learning stability actor-critic methods are commonly used. They divide the tasks in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Actor**: Learns a deterministic policy for choosing actions. Uses policy gradient methods to maximize expected reward.\n",
    "* **Critic**: Learns a value function using Temporal Difference (TD) learning. Provides feedback to the actor based on action quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Multi-Agent RL\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world electricity markets involve multiple agents acting simultaneously, which introduces interdependencies and non-stationarity. The latter refers to the fact that the continuous adaptation of other agents makes the environment change and therefore less predictable from the perspective of a single agent. As a result, multi-agent learning requires additional considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, ASSUME employs the **Multi-Agent Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MATD3)** framework with CTDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Centralized Training**: A critic with access to all agents' states and actions is used during training to stabilize learning. Note the critic is only there to update the actor network, so it is only necessary while training. \n",
    "* **Decentralized Execution**: During simulation, the actual actor of each agent relies only on its own observations and learned policy.\n",
