    "# 4.3 Storage Units: Learning Temporal Bidding Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we extend the **reinforcement learning (RL)** framework to **storage units**, such as batteries, which face a unique decision structure: they must **buy energy (charge) when prices are low** and **sell it (discharge) when prices are high**, across multiple time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **temporal coupling** of actions and rewards. Unlike generators that can profit immediately from selling electricity and are only time-coupled due to technical constraints (ramping, shut down etc), storage units must learn to plan ahead, accepting short-term costs in anticipation of future gains. As such, both the **observation space** and **reward design** need to reflect this temporal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is again designed to walk you through the essential components required to transform a conventional storage into an RL agent. Rather than concentrating on the underlying algorithmic infrastructure—such as training loops, buffers, or learning roles—this tutorial emphasizes **how to define a bidding strategy that interfaces with the ASSUME learning backend**. You will learn how to construct observation spaces, define action mappings, and design reward functions that guide agent behavior, but this time for a storage unit. If you have done the [04b_RL_example](./04b_reinforcement_learning_example.ipynb) some parts will be familiar, since this is designed as a stand-alone tutorial as well. Mainly step 1. **ASSUME & Learning Basics** and 2. **Get ASSUME Running** can be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each core concept is addressed in a dedicated chapter, accompanied by exercises that allow you to apply the material directly. These hands-on tasks culminate in a final integration chapter where you will run a complete simulation and train your first learning agent."

This feedback between its bidding strategy and the resulting price allows it to understand the reward signal more clearly and improve faster. In contrast, Storage 1 rarely becomes price-setting and thus finds it harder to link its actions to outcomes. Without this feedback loop, learning is significantly slower or even stagnant. Here we can see a slight increase in the evaluation rewrad ar the end, that indicates storage 1 might recover.\n",

    "The plot above shows the **accepted market prices** for storage bids over time, separated into **buy bids** (charging) and **sell bids** (discharging). Each point represents a successful bid that was accepted by the market at a specific time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Blue dots** indicate charging actions (buy bids), where the storage unit purchases electricity at lower prices.\n",
    "- **Orange dots** represent discharging actions (sell bids), where electricity is sold back to the market at higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the visual distribution, we can observe a typical storage behavior:\n",
    "- Charging occurs during **low-price hours**, typically at night or early morning.\n",
    "- Discharging is concentrated in **higher-price hours**, typically in the afternoon or evening.\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the agent has learned a basic arbitrage strategy — **charge low, discharge high** — which aligns with economic incentives. The spread between buy and sell prices is essential for generating profit and, consequently, positive rewards.\n",

    "While this gives insight into the **agent’s strategy and confidence**, it’s important to compare this behavior against a **benchmark** to judge its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a **single storage unit**, a common benchmark is a **perfect-foresight optimization**, which computes the best possible charging and discharging schedule based on known future prices. This shows how close the RL agent gets to the theoretical optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, if you have **multiple storage agents**, their actions can **influence market prices**. In this case, the environment becomes **strategic and interdependent**, and a simple optimization no longer reflects the true benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For such settings, the appropriate comparison is a **Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC)** or other game-theoretic models. These account for the fact that **agents anticipate their own market impact**, and provide a consistent equilibrium benchmark."

    "\n",
    "* Observe market signals and internal state-of-charge dynamics.\n",

    "* Receive profit-based reward signals and adapt behavior over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "* How to construct **observation spaces** that reflect temporal coupling and internal energy cost.\n",
    "* How to define **bid direction and price** using a compact action space.\n",
    "* Why **realized profit** is used as the reward signal, and why opportunity cost is avoided for storage.\n",
    "* How to scale rewards and update the **cost of stored energy** after market interactions.\n",
    "* How to train and evaluate a storage agent’s behavior in **multi-agent DRL simulations**."

    "Your implementation is modular and extensible. Here are several directions you can explore on your own:\n",

    "1. **Adjust Learning Parameters**\n",
    "\n",

    "* `learning_rate`, `gamma`, `noise_sigma`, `episodes_collecting_initial_experience`\n",
    "* `validation_episodes_interval`, `train_freq`, or `gradient_steps`\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe how these changes affect convergence, stability, and bidding behavior.\n",

    "2. **Try Different Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjust scenario inputs of example `02e`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Remove the second storage unit from the `storage_units.csv` file.\n",
    "  * Add many learning agents, simulating a highly competitive environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare bidding behavior and reward dynamics across settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dive into other tutorials**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are interested in the general algorithm behind the MADDPG and how it is integrated into ASSUME look into [04a_RL_algorithm_example](./04a_reinforcement_learning_algorithm_example.ipynb) \n",
    "* In the small example we could see what the a good bidding behavior of the agent might be and, hence, can judge learning easily, but what if we model many agents in new simulations? We provide explainable RL mechanisms in another tutorial for you to dive into [09_example_Sim_and_xRL](./09_example_Sim_and_xRL.ipynb) \n"
