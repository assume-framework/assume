    "Welcome to the second tutorial in the ASSUME framework series. In the previous tutorial, we learned how to manually set up and execute simulations. However, for larger simulations involving multiple agents and demand series, it's more efficient to automate the process using configuration files and input files. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of creating these files and using them to run simulations in ASSUME.\n",

Afterwards, each demand unit following a naive bidding strategy will bid the respective demand value into the market.\n",

If the time series is longer than the simulation time horizon, the framework will automatically truncate it to the correct length.

If the resolution of the time series is higher than the simulation time step, the framework will automatically resample the time series to match the simulation time step. If it is shorter, an error will be raised."
