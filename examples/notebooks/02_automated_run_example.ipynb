    "Welcome to the second tutorial in the ASSUME framework series. In the previous tutorial, we learned how to manually set up and execute simulations. However, for larger simulations involving multiple agents and demand series, it's more efficient to automate the process using configuration files and input files. This tutorial will guide you through the steps of creating these files and using them to run simulations in ASSUME.\n",
