    "# 6. Using advanced orders: Effects of regular block orders and linked orders\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases the impact of regular block and linked orders in electricity market simulation outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the advanced strategies using regular block orders and linked orders are presented and their impact on the market outcome both on system and unit level compared to strategies using only single hourly orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the integration of block orders, minimum acceptance ratios are added to the orders as additional field. To account for those in the clearing, a new market clearing algorithm becomes necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show, how to create and integrate this advanced market clearing and adjust bidding strategies to allow the use of regular block orders and linked orders.\n",
    "Finally, we will create a small comparison study of the results using matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As a whole, this tutorial covers the following**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain the basic rules of block and linked orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run a small example with single hourly orders.\n",

    "## 1. Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, most simulation studies only focus on single hourly orders.\n",
    "Yet, the reality includes a lot more than that, especially different types of block orders.\n",
    "The question is, how much do the advanced order types deviate the market outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase that ASSUME can handle different order types an advanced market clearing algorithm is created and tested with three different strategies.\n",
    "The testing scenarios are defined as 12 units (one for each technology) and an unflexible demand, cleared on a day-ahead market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are single hourly orders?**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the simplest order structures implemented, also called simple orders. \n",
    "They can take the form of linear piece-wise curves containing interpolated orders only, step-wise curves containing step orders only, or a hybrid form of both. \n",
    "The general clearing of these orders strictly follows the merit order principle:\n",
    "any order with a bidding price below the MCP must be fully accepted, any order with a price above the MCP must be rejected, and orders where the price equals the MCP can be either accepted (fully/partially) or rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are block orders?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristic of block orders is a time horizon that spans multiple minimum time units (MTUs). \n",
    "They are defined by a price, a number of time periods, some volumes that can be different for each period, and a constant minimum acceptance ratio (MAR). \n",
    "The MAR defines a restriction on how much a bid can be curtailed before it must be rejected. \n",
    "They can be divided into four subcategories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Independent block orders (BOs)**: \n",
    "The elemental form is the regular block order, with constant volume and a MAR equal to 1, also referred to as “fill-or-kill”-condition.\n",
    "This determines that the volume must be entirely accepted or rejected. \n",
    "This BO-type is used most frequently and applied in all European power exchanges [Devnath et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/2050-7038.12360) and implemented in most models [Tanrisever et al. 2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3517267). \n",
    "Slight deviations are given with the curtailable BO, where the MAR can be below 1, and the profile BO, which includes volume changes over the block order periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linked groups or linked orders (LOs)**: \n",
    "These groups of orders include parent and dependent child orders with the additional condition that the acceptance ratio\n",
    "of a parent order must be greater or equal to those of all child orders. \n",
    "During market clearing, children are considered, if they increase the profit. \n",
    "Hence, they can “save” the parent order, but not vice versa. \n",
    "There can be several levels of LOs in one group, but the number of children and levels is constrained by the power exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exclusive groups**: \n",
    "For this order type, the sum of acceptance ratios of a set of block orders must be below 1. \n",
    "If the MAR is set to 1, this results in an exclusive-or-relation of all orders in that group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexible orders**: \n",
    "These order structures are created through the formation of an exclusive group where the MAR is set to 1 and each order is shifted by one hour, introducing flexibility through the dispatch time determined by the\n",
    "algorithm, not predefined by the participant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will compare the simple hourly orders with regular block orders and linked orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bid formulation in this example**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to flexABLE, the inflexible and flexible power of a unit is bid seperately, compare [Qussous et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/en15020494).\n",
    "\n",
    "The inflexible power $P^{\\mathrm{inflex}}_{t}$ at time $t$ is the minimum volume that can by dispatched. \n",
    "It is defined by the current operation status of the unit, ramp-down limitations and the must-run time.\n",
    "The inflexible bid price depends on the marginal cost $C^{\\mathrm{marginal}}_t$ at time $t$ and the power dispatch of the previous time step $P^{\\mathrm{dispatch}}_{t-1}$ and adds a markup, if the unit has to be started newly and a reduction, to prevent a shut-down, including the start-up costs $C^{\\mathrm{su}}_t$.\n",
    "Here, the average time of continuous operation is given by $T^{\\mathrm{op, avg}}$ and the average time of continuous shut down is given by $T^{\\mathrm{down, avg}}$:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "C^{\\mathrm{inflex}}_t=C^{\\mathrm{marginal}}_t + \\frac{C^{\\mathrm{su}}_t}{P^{\\mathrm{inflex}}_{t} T^{\\mathrm{op/down}}} \\quad \\mathrm{with} \\: T^{\\mathrm{op/down}} = \\begin{cases} -T^{\\mathrm{down, avg}}, & \\mathrm{if} \\: P^{\\mathrm{dispatch}}_{t-1} > 0 \\\\ T^{\\mathrm{op, avg}}, & \\mathrm{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The flexible power $P^{\\mathrm{flex}}_{t}$ at time $t$ is then the difference between maximum dispatchable volume and the inflexible power. \n",
    "It is defined by current operation status of the unit, ramp-up limitations and the must-operation time.\n",
    "The flexible bidding price is given by the marginal costs only:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C^{\\mathrm{flex}}_t=C^{\\mathrm{marginal}}_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "When transforming those bids into block orders, the volumes of the inflexible bids build the profile of one block bid over 24 hours.\n",
    "Because block orders are cleared according to the average market clearing price over the order period $\\mathcal{T}$, the price of the block order is given by the weighted average of the inflexible bid price:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C^{\\mathrm{block}} = \\frac{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} C^{\\mathrm{inflex}}_t \\: P^{\\mathrm{inflex}}_t}{\\sum_{t \\in \\mathcal{T}} P^{\\mathrm{inflex}}_t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The linked orders are built by the flexible power for each hour linked as children to the inflexible block bid.\n",
    "They then use directly the flexible bid price $C^{\\mathrm{flex}}_t$.\n"
