    Sets up and solves the market clearing optimization problem.

    Args:
        orders (Orderbook): The list of the orders.
        market_products (list[MarketProduct]): The products to be traded.
        mode (str): The mode of the market clearing determining whether the minimum acceptance ratio is considered.

        incidence_matrix (pd.DataFrame): The incidence matrix of the network. (Shows the connections between nodes.)

    Notes:
        The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and solved using the pyomo package.
        The objective function is to maximize the social welfare and defined as the sum of the product of the price, volume, and acceptance ratio of each order.
        The decision variables are given by the acceptance ratio of each order bounded by 0 and 1 and the acceptance as a binary variable.

        The energy balance constraint ensures that the sum of the accepted volumes of all orders is zero.
        The acceptance of each order is bounded by 0 and 1.

        If the mode is 'with_min_acceptance_ratio', the minimum acceptance ratio is considered.
        The minimum acceptance ratio is defined as the ratio of the minimum volume to accept to the total volume of the order.

        If linked bids are considered, the acceptance of a child bid is bounded by the acceptance of its parent bid.

        The market clearing is solved using pyomo with the specified solver (HIGHS is used by default).
        If the specified solver is not available, the model is solved using available solver.
        If none of the solvers are available, an exception is raised.

        After solving the model, the acceptance of each order is fixed to the value in the solution and the model is solved again.
        This removes all binary variables from the model and allows to extract the market clearing prices from the dual variables of the energy balance constraint.
