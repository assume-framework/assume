class RLAdvancedOrderStrategy(RLStrategy):
    """
    Reinforcement Learning Strategy for an Energy-Only-Market with simple hourly, block and linked orders.

    Attributes:
        foresight (int): Number of time steps to look ahead. Default 24.
        max_bid_price (float): The maximum bid price.
        max_demand (float): The maximum demand.
        device (str): The device to run on.
        float_type (str): The float type to use.
        learning_mode (bool): Whether to use learning mode.
        algorithm (str): RL algorithm. Defaults to "matd3".
        actor_architecture_class (type[torch.nn.Module]): Actor network class. Defaults to "MLPActor".
        actor (torch.nn.Module): The actor network.
        order_types (list[str]): The list of order types to use (SB, LB, BB).
        episodes_collecting_initial_experience (int): Number of episodes to collect initial experience.

    Args:
        *args: Variable length argument list.
        **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Note:
        This strategy is based on the strategy in flexable.py, but uses the actor network to determine the prices
        instead of using the marginal costs as in flexable.py.
        The two prices for flexible and inflexible power are determined by the actor network,
        which is trained with the MATD3 algorithm.
        The maximum of those two prices is used for the flexible bid and the minimum for the inflexible bid.
        The order type is set implicitly (not by the RL agent itself) and the structure depends on
        the allowed order types:
        If only simple hourly orders (SB) are allowed, the strategy will only use SB for both inflexible and flexible power.
        If SB and linked orders (LB) are allowed, the strategy will use SB for the inflexible power and LB for the flexible power.
        If SB and block orders (BB) are allowed, the strategy will use BB for the inflexible power and SB for the flexible power.
        If all three order types (SB, BB, LB) are allowed, the strategy will use BB for the inflexible power
        and LB for the flexible power, except the inflexible power is 0,
        then it will use SB for the flexible power (as for VREs).
