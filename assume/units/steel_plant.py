        Establishes the process sequence and constraints for the steel plant, ensuring that

        This function defines three key constraints:

        1. **Direct Hydrogen Flow Constraint**:
        - Ensures that hydrogen produced by the electrolyzer is either supplied directly
            to the DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) plant or stored in hydrogen buffer storage.
        - If storage is available, the constraint balances hydrogen inflow and outflow
            between the electrolyzer, hydrogen storage, and the DRI plant.
        - If no electrolyzer exists, it ensures that the DRI plant has an alternative hydrogen
            source (i.e., imported hydrogen).

        2. **Direct DRI Flow Constraint**:
        - Regulates the flow of directly reduced iron (DRI) from the DRI plant to the Electric Arc
            Furnace (EAF) or DRI storage.
        - If DRI storage is present, it ensures that part of the produced DRI can be stored
            for later use, maintaining balance between production, storage, and consumption in the EAF.
        - If no storage is available, all produced DRI must go directly to the EAF.

        3. **Material Flow Constraint from DRI Plant to Electric Arc Furnace**:
        - Ensures that all DRI produced by the DRI plant is consumed by the Electric Arc Furnace.
        - This constraint enforces that the total material output from the DRI plant must match
            the required DRI input for the EAF, preventing material imbalances.

        These constraints collectively ensure proper material and energy flow within the steel
        production process, maintaining energy efficiency and operational feasibility.

        - This constraint enforces a global balance between steel production and demand over
            the entire time horizon, rather than enforcing it at each individual time step.

        2. **Total Power Input Constraint**:
        - Ensures that the total power input to the steel plant equals the sum of the power
            consumption of all energy-intensive components, including the EAF, DRI plant,
            and electrolyzer (if present).
        - This constraint ensures that energy demand is correctly accounted for and used
            in the optimization process.

        3. **Variable Cost per Time Step Constraint**:
        - Calculates the total variable operating cost per time step based on the power
            consumption and operating costs of the EAF, DRI plant, and electrolyzer (if available).
        - This constraint is useful for cost optimization, as it ensures that the total
            variable cost is accurately computed for each time step.
